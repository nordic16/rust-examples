## Rust-examples: My attempt at explaining rust concepts.

In this repo, I will post explanations of some rust concepts as I learn. If you want to contribute, feel free to fork this repo then make a pull request.

So far, it features:
  * Ownership. 
  * Pattern matching (through `match` and `if let`).
  * Modules.
  * Strings.

**Note:** This repo isn't meant to be a complete learning resource for Rust. I prefer thinking of it as notes that can help people understanding some concepts.
